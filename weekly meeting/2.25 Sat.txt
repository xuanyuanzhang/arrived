A few things to be clarified:
1. I have already created the template, including:
	- Header
	- A carousel
	- A search bar
	- pictures inline that can be used as links
	- News zone
	- Sending email area (if we have a chatbot that part may be replaced)
	- footage
These are not expected to be all used in one single page. Instead, they can be used potentially by 
some other features we want to add. We can extend my header and footage while inserting different 
information in various pages. 

2. Plan on the pages that we need.
   As what I have listed in header selection bar, we need four major parts migrated from Android:
	- Learn, which is a list of scroll bars containing information in detail. 
		Q: Are these texts loaded from database or directly stored in HTML file? (guess we better
		make them )
	- See, a map containing marks on stations that people can seek help.
	- Watch, a page that contains a youtube video.
	- About, some information about us, our purpose in building this app, and what are some researches,
	  progress we have made in this field.
   These are parts we can split out works. 

   Q: What are some extra features we need. (I remember something like discussion forum we talked about last
	time)

3. Connections to backend.

4. What host we will be using. Suggestions?

5. Schedule.
	- 2.25-3.4
	- 3.4-3.11
	- 3.11-3.18
	- 3.18-3.25
	- 3.25-4.1
