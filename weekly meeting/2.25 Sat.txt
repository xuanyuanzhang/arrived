1. Plan on the pages that we need.

   As what I have listed in header selection bar, we need four major parts migrated from Android:
	- Learn, which is a list of scroll bars containing information in detail. 
		Q: Are these texts loaded from database or directly stored in HTML file? (guess we better
		make them connected to database for automatic update) XML from website. 
	- See, a map containing marks on stations that people can seek help.
	- Watch, a page that contains a youtube video.
	- About, some information about us, our purpose in building this app, and what are some researches,
	  progress we have made in this field.
   These are parts we can split out works. 

   Q: What are some extra features we need. (I remember something like discussion forum we talked about last
	time)
   A: 
      -	backend editing allow researchers Q&A. Translators provide translation. User friendly way
	to edit. 
      - web app having own users can ask questions. (community)

2. What host we will be using. Suggestions?
	We have free azure credits. (azure!)

	- 3.4-3.11 
	- 3.11-3.18
